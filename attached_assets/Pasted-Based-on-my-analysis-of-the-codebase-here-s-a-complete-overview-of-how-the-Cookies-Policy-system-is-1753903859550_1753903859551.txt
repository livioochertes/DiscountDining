Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a complete overview of how the Cookies Policy system is implemented and how it can be accessed by other applications:

1. Page Structure and Routing
The Cookie Policy is implemented as a dedicated page at /cookie-policy route:

Route: /cookie-policy (defined in client/src/App.tsx)
Component: client/src/pages/cookie-policy.tsx
Loading: Lazy-loaded for performance optimization
2. Core Components Architecture
A. Cookie Policy Page (cookie-policy.tsx)
Professional layout with header navigation
Comprehensive sections covering:
What are cookies
Cookie types (Necessary, Analytics, Marketing)
How to control cookies
Browser-specific management links
Contact information and last updated date
B. Cookie Banner (cookie-banner.tsx)
Appears automatically for new users
Provides three options: Accept All, Reject All, Cookie Settings
Stores preferences in localStorage as 'cookieConsent'
Custom event system for external control
C. Cookie Settings Link (cookie-settings-link.tsx)
Reusable component that can be placed anywhere
Supports multiple variants: link, button, ghost, outline
Triggers cookie settings dialog programmatically
3. Access Methods for Other Applications
A. Direct URL Access
https://your-domain.com/cookie-policy
B. Programmatic Access
// Open cookie settings programmatically
import { openCookieSettings } from '@/lib/cookie-settings';
openCookieSettings();
// Check cookie preferences
import { getCookiePreferences, isCookieCategoryEnabled } from '@/lib/cookie-settings';
const preferences = getCookiePreferences();
const analyticsEnabled = isCookieCategoryEnabled('analytics');
C. Component Integration
// Add cookie settings link anywhere in your app
import CookieSettingsLink from '@/components/cookie-settings-link';
<CookieSettingsLink 
  variant="button" 
  size="sm" 
  showIcon={true} 
  className="custom-styling"
/>
4. Footer Integration
The footer provides access through:

Direct link to Cookie Policy page
Cookie Settings button for preference management
Positioned alongside Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions
5. Multilingual Support
The system includes full internationalization:

English and Romanian language support
Translation keys for all cookie-related text
Dynamic content based on user language preference
6. Technical Implementation Details
A. Cookie Categories Supported
Necessary: Always enabled, essential for website functionality
Analytics: User tracking and website improvement
Marketing: Personalized advertisements
Preferences: User customization settings
B. Storage Mechanism
Uses localStorage with key 'cookieConsent'
JSON format storing boolean values for each category
Persistent across browser sessions
C. Event System
Custom event 'openCookieSettings' for external triggers
Window-level event listeners for cross-component communication
7. GDPR Compliance Features
Clear consent mechanism
Granular cookie control
Easy preference modification
Transparent information about cookie usage
Contact information for data protection inquiries
8. Integration Points for Other Applications
A. Standalone Implementation
Copy these key files:

cookie-policy.tsx (main page)
cookie-banner.tsx (consent management)
cookie-settings-link.tsx (trigger component)
cookie-settings.ts (utility functions)
B. API-like Access
The utility functions provide a clean interface:

// Check if user has made cookie choices
const hasConsent = getCookiePreferences() !== null;
// Get specific category status
const canUseAnalytics = isCookieCategoryEnabled('analytics');
// Trigger settings dialog
openCookieSettings();
C. Styling Customization
Uses Tailwind CSS classes
Shadcn/ui components for consistency
Customizable through className props
Responsive design included
9. Best Practices for Implementation
Performance: The page is lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size
Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
User Experience: Non-intrusive banner with clear options
Legal Compliance: Comprehensive policy text with external links
Flexibility: Modular components for easy integration
This implementation provides a complete, GDPR-compliant cookie management system that can be easily integrated into other applications or used as a reference for similar implementations.
