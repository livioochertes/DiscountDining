For your EatOff platform, I recommend converting your existing React web app into a PWA because:

1. **No rewrite needed** - Uses your existing code
2. **Works everywhere** - Android, iOS, desktop
3. **Easy deployment** - No app store hassles
4. **Native-like experience** - Can be installed, has push notifications
5. **Always up-to-date** - Updates automatically
6. **Cost effective** - No need to maintain separate mobile codebase
